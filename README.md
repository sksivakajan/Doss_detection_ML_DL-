What I Did

In this project, I designed and implemented a scalable DDoS traffic analysis and detection framework capable of processing large PCAP datasets efficiently. I developed a modular architecture to separate network traffic into protocol-specific components such as UDP, TCP SYN, ICMP, and IP fragmentation. Using a time-window–based approach, I engineered statistical features from raw packet data and built a structured feature store using the Parquet format for high-performance storage and machine learning readiness. Additionally, I implemented a UDP severity scoring system to classify traffic intensity levels (Low to Critical), forming the foundation for automated attack detection. The system was designed to handle large-scale datasets safely using streaming packet processing, ensuring memory efficiency and scalability for future model training and real-time detection extensions
